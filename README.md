# 🌊 Flood Forecasting using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
Floods are among the most frequent and destructive natural disasters worldwide. This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to forecast potential flood occurrences based on meteorological and hydrological data, enabling early warnings and informed disaster management decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze weather and environmental parameters such as rainfall, humidity, and water level.  
- Build a predictive model to forecast flood probability.  
- Reduce disaster impact through timely and data-driven insights.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Sourced rainfall, temperature, humidity, and river level data from open datasets (e.g., Kaggle, IMD).  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned missing values, normalized features, and handled outliers.  
3. **Model Training** – Implemented and compared algorithms including:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - XGBoost  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.  
5. **Visualization** – Created correlation maps and flood probability graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## 📊 Results
- The **Random Forest model** achieved the highest accuracy and stable performance.  
- Strong correlation observed between rainfall intensity and flood probability.  
- Visualization dashboards aid in understanding environmental patterns.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate **real-time IoT data** for continuous flood monitoring.  
- Deploy model using **Flask/Django** for live predictions.  
- Extend with **Deep Learning (LSTM)** for time-series forecasting.  
- Add **GIS visualization** for mapping flood-prone regions.
